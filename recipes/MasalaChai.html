<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Indian masala chai is a traditional, aromatic, and spiced tea beverage that originated in India. It combines black tea leaves (usually Assam or Darjeeling) with a blend of spices, milk, and a sweetener.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
    <li>2 tsp black tea leaves or 2 tea bags (Assam or Darjeeling tea)</li>
    <li>1-inch piece of ginger, crushed</li>
    <li>2 green cardamom pods, crushed</li>
    <li>1 small cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>2 cloves</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp fennel seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black peppercorns (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tsp sugar, or to taste (can also use honey or other sweeteners)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine water, crushed ginger, crushed cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, fennel seeds (if using), and black peppercorns (if using). Bring to a boil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Allow the mixture to boil for 2-3 minutes, so the flavors of the spices infuse into the water.</li>
    <li>Add black tea leaves or tea bags to the saucepan and let it boil for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in the milk and stir gently. Bring the mixture back to a gentle boil and then reduce the heat to low, letting it simmer for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add sugar or your preferred sweetener, stirring well to dissolve it.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and let the chai steep for a minute or two to enhance the flavors.</li>
    <li>Strain the masala chai through a fine mesh strainer into cups or a teapot, discarding the solids.</li>
    <li>Serve the masala chai hot, with biscuits or snacks of your choice.</li>
